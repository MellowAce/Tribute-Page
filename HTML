       <p>Kirito was chosen to be one of the one thousand beta testers for the closed</p> 
       <p>beta of Sword Art Online, the first ever Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer</p> 
       <p>Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) for the NerveGear, and later joined the official</p> 
       <p>version of the game. He thus became one of the 10,000 players who were trapped in</p> 
       <p>Sword Art Online, where he remained a solo player for the majority of the game,</p> 
       <p>willingly taking on the role of a Beater to reduce discrimination against other</p> 
       <p>former beta testers, as well as actively taking part in Boss battles as one of the</p> 
       <p>Clearers. Kirito temporarily became a member of the Moonlit Black Cats after helping</p> 
       <p>them safely escape a dangerous dungeon, but returned to being a solo player when a</p> 
       <p>fatal error resulted in the death of the other guild members. </p>

       <p>At some point in the game, Kirito became known as the «Black Swordsman» due to</p> 
       <p>his tendency to wear black clothing. Near the end of the game, Kirito joined the</p>
       <p>Knights of the Blood due to losing a wager with its leader, Heathcliff. Kirito</p>
       <p>eventually put an end to the game by defeating the final boss, thus clearing the game.</p>
